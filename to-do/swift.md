swift COmmand Line tools!!!! <br/>
Swift is a great language for building command line tools, but there's more to a command line tool than just the ability to run from Terminal. What about commands, and arguments? Or flags that only apply to certain commands? It can be tough to make the "UI" for a command line tool follow conventions and make sense to users. Guaka should come in handy if you're building anything more than the most trivial tool.
